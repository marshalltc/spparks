<b>Alloy Application for SPPARKS:<b>
  <b>This code is not actively maintained but is provided as a reference for previous research work<b>

![Nanorods](doc/doc_dependencies/movie.gif)

This repository has three goals. 

<ol>
<li>Provide a new C/C++ application as a part of the SPPARKS package to model alloys.</li>

<li>Include a variety of example scripts to make learning SPPARKS easier.</li>

<li>Provide an example script to wrap SPPARKS and LAMMPS so that it is easier to go from a Monte Carlo simulation to a molecular dynamic one.  </li>
</ol>

<p>
The documentation comes with a quick start guide to get you up and running in a matter of minutes using the examples.  If you are not familar with Monte Carlo simulations or molecular dynamics you can find information about it at https://spparks.sandia.gov/. and https://lammps.sandia.gov/. Learning the details of these simulations and how they work are nontrivial and the subject of a lot of academic research. If you are looking for more well defined and intuitive physics based simulators this is not the repository for you. If you are looking for a robust package that can be used for practically any atomistic simulation then it is worth taking the time to learn how to code for SPPARKS and LAMMPS. If you have a particular simulation in mind and need help writing a script for it, feel free to submit a request and I might be able to add it to the package.
